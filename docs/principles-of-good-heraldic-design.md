## Core Principles

### Simplicity

**Simplicity** is a core principle in heraldic design. Keeping designs straightforward and recognizable ensures that the coat of arms is easily understood and remembered.

- **Avoid Overcrowding:** Limit the number of charges and tinctures.
- **Focus on Key Elements:** Highlight the most important symbols.

### Contrast

**Contrast** ensures that elements stand out from each other, enhancing visibility and distinction.

- **Use Tinctures Wisely:** Follow the rule of tincture to create strong contrasts.
- **Highlight Key Features:** Ensure primary charges are distinct from the field and secondary charges.

!!! example "High Contrast Design"
    Or, a lion rampant Sable.

### Balance

**Balance** involves achieving visual harmony in the composition, ensuring that all elements are evenly distributed and proportionate.

- **Symmetrical Arrangements:** Use symmetrical arrangements to create a balanced look.
- **Even Spacing:** Ensure even spacing between charges.

!!! tip "Balanced Design"
    Balanced designs are aesthetically pleasing and convey a sense of order.

### Symbolism

**Symbolism** is the effective use of symbols to convey meaning. Each element in a coat of arms should have a clear and relevant symbolic significance.

- **Choose Relevant Symbols:** Select symbols that reflect the bearerâ€™s identity and values.
- **Consistent Theme:** Maintain a consistent theme throughout the design.

!!! note "Symbolic Design"
    A good heraldic design tells a story through its symbols, making it meaningful and memorable.
