# Module 1.2: Historical Origins in Medieval Europe

## Early Beginnings

### Emergence During the 12th Century

Heraldry began to emerge in the 12th century as a formal system for identifying knights and nobility. It developed in response to the need for recognizable symbols in battles and tournaments, where armored knights were otherwise indistinguishable.

### Initial Use by Knights and Nobility

Initially, heraldic symbols were simple and practical, used primarily by knights and nobility. These symbols were painted on shields, surcoats, and banners to distinguish individuals and their followers on the battlefield and in tournaments.

## Development Over Time

### How Heraldry Spread Across Europe

Heraldry quickly spread across Europe as its utility and significance were recognized. Each region developed its unique styles and traditions while adhering to common heraldic principles. Heralds, or officials responsible for overseeing and recording coats of arms, played a key role in this dissemination.

## Significance in Society

### Role in Tournaments and Battles

In medieval society, heraldry played a crucial role in tournaments and battles. Tournaments were social and martial events where knights displayed their heraldic arms on shields and banners. In battles, heraldic symbols helped identify friend from foe and signaled alliances and loyalties.

### Symbol of Lineage and Heritage

Heraldry also served as a symbol of lineage and heritage, representing the familial and personal achievements of the bearer. Coats of arms were passed down through generations, with each new generation adding its own marks of distinction, known as "differences" or "cadency marks."
