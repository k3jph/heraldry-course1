# Module 1.1: Definition of Heraldry

## What is Heraldry?

### Introduction to Heraldry as a System of Identification

Heraldry is a system of identification that originated in medieval Europe, designed to identify individuals and families, particularly in battle. It encompasses the design, display, and study of armorial bearings (known as armory) and related insignia such as crests, badges, and banners.

    While heraldry includes symbols and emblems, it is distinct in its strict rules and traditions governing the design and use of these elements. Heraldic symbols are formally registered and regulated by heraldic authorities.

### Difference Between Heraldry and General Symbols/Emblems

Heraldic symbols are unique and regulated, designed to represent lineage and achievements. In contrast, general symbols and emblems might not follow specific rules and can be used more freely in various contexts.

## Components of Heraldry

### Coats of Arms, Crests, and Badges

Heraldry comprises several key elements, each with a specific function and meaning:

- **Coat of Arms:** The central element, displayed on a shield. It includes a combination of colors, symbols, and patterns unique to an individual or family.
- **Crest:** Positioned above the helmet in a full heraldic achievement, often representing a secondary aspect of the bearer's identity.
- **Badge:** A simpler symbol used for identification, often without the formal structure of a coat of arms.

### The Structure of a Coat of Arms

A typical coat of arms consists of the following parts:

- **Shield (Escutcheon):** The main area displaying the armory.
- **Helm (Helmet):** Positioned above the shield, indicating the bearer's rank.
- **Mantling:** Decorative cloth draped from the helmet.
- **Torse:** A twisted band of fabric above the shield.
- **Crest:** A figure or device atop the helmet.
- **Motto:** A phrase expressing the bearer's principles or achievements.
- **Supporters:** Figures standing beside the shield, typically found in the arms of nobility.

## Purpose and Use

### Use in Medieval Times vs. Modern Applications

In medieval times, heraldry was essential for identifying knights in armor and signaling allegiances in battle. Coats of arms were granted by heraldic authorities and were hereditary, passed down through generations.
